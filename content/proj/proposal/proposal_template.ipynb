    "\n",
    "1. **Proposal** (5%)\n",
    "   - A notebook proposing a dataset to work with (based on this template)\n",
    "2. **Report** (10%)\n",
    "   - A notebook detailing the dataset, your question, the model, and your findings\n",
    "   - See the section **Report Rubric** in the file `report_template.ipynb` under\n",
    "   `proj/finalproject` for details and a point breakdown.\n",
    "3. **Presentation** (10%)\n",
    "   - A Google Slides presentation summarizing the content of the report\n",
    "   - Delivered in-class, of no longer than 5 minutes in length.\n",

    "\n",
    "Please try to limit your submissions of both the project and proposal to only one,\n",
