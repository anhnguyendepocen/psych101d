## Grading
This breakdown is subject to change, but the plan is

- Homework/Labs: 45%
- Midterm Exam: 15%
- Final Exam: 15%
- Final Project: 25%

Note that exams are together worth under a third of the final grade.

The lowest graded homework and lab will be dropped from the average.

Late work is accepted, with a 10% penalty applying at the deadline
and every 24 hours after that point.
