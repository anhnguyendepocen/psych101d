## Python Resources

There are numerous resources online for folks interested in learning Python.
The subreddit [r/learnpython](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython)
is one, and it collects, in its
[wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/wiki/index),
a long list of others.
These resources include videos and lectures,
tools, and links to online books and courses.
They are aimed at a variety of levels, backgrounds, and learning styles.

Of particular interest are:

- [Introduction to Python for Data Science](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/intro-to-python-for-data-science),
which does not assume any background
- [SoloLearn's Python 3 Course](https://www.sololearn.com/Course/Python/),
which also assumes no background and works in the browser
- [Python for Data Science](https://cognitiveclass.ai/courses/python-for-data-science),
a slightly more advanced set of video lectures for folks with some Python experience

Two libraries we'll use heavily in this class are
[`pyMC3`](https://docs.pymc.io/) and
[`pandas`](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/).
Teaching you to use `pyMC` effectively is a major goal of the course.
Pandas will be the library that manages our tables of data, with its `DataFrame` class.
Students coming from data8 will recognize a `pandas.DataFrame`
as something quite close to the `datascience.Table`,
but with more features and more rough edges.

Using `pandas` effectively is a large part of being a practicing data scientist
in Python, and is increasingly used in research science as well.
If you'd like to learn more about how to use `pandas`, check out
[this video tutorial by Brandon Rhodes](https://github.com/brandon-rhodes/pycon-pandas-tutorial).
If you click the "Download Zip" button as directed,
and upload the files to your datahub,
you can follow along with the exercises.
